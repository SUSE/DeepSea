.TH deepsea-monitor 1 "DeepSea CLI man page"
.SH NAME
deepsea-monitor - Starts the DeepSea stage execution progress monitor.

.SH SYNOPSIS
deepsea monitor [--help] [--show-dynamic-steps] [--show-state-steps]
                [--simple-output]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Starts the DeepSea stage execution progress monitor.

The progress monitor provides a detailed, real-time visualization of what is
happening during execution of stages using
.B salt-run state.orch
commands in other terminal sessions.


The user must start the monitor before running any
.I salt-run state.orch
so that the monitor can detect the start of the stage's execution.

If the user starts the monitor after issuing the
.I salt-run state.orch
command, then no execution progress will be shown.

.SH OPTIONS
.B --help
.RS
Shows the help message.

.B --show-dynamic-steps
.RS
Enables the visualization of dynamic steps. Dynamic steps are
steps generated by python code or Jinja templates.

.B Caution:
If you enable this option, you might see execution steps that are generated by
the monitor itself and do not correspond to the real execution.

.RE
.B --show-state-steps
.RS
Enables the visualization of Salt state intermediate steps. Only
state steps that have the option
.B fire_event=True
are shown
.RE
.RS
.B Caution:
If you enable this option, the stage parsing stage that occurs when the stage
starts its execution might take much longer, which will defer the execution
progress visualization for an undetermined period of time.

.RE
.B --simple-output
.RS
Enables a minimalistic visualization layout without colors.
Useful when redirecting the monitor output to a text file.
