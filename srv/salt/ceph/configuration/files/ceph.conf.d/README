Custom Configuration

The default ceph.conf template
(<salt_dir>/ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.j2) includes the content of five
files from the <salt_dir>/ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.d directory. These
files are [global,mon,mds,osd,client].conf and are meant for user
customisations of ceph.conf.

The five files correspond to the different sections the Ceph configuration file
accepts (see also
http://docs.ceph.com/docs/jewel/rados/configuration/ceph-conf/#config-sections).
Putting a configuration fragment in the correct file enables DeepSea to place it
into the correct section. A user does not have to add any of the five section
headers.
A user can however add daemon specific headers. If any configuration options
should only be applied to specific instances of a daemon a header like
[osd.1] can be added. The following configuration options will only be applied
to the OSD daemon with the id 1.

Later statements in a particular section will overwrite earlier ones. Thus it is
possible to override the default configuration as specified in
<salt_dir>/ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.j2.
For example to turn off cephx authentication, add the following three lines to
<salt_dir>/ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.d/global.conf:
auth cluster required = none
auth service required = none
auth client required = none

If a lot of custom configurations should be applied a user is free to use jinja
include statements within the custom configuration files to make file management
easier. For example the osd.conf file could look like this:
[osd.1]
{% include "ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.d/osd1.conf" ignore missing %}
[osd.2]
{% include "ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.d/osd2.conf" ignore missing %}
[osd.3]
{% include "ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.d/osd3.conf" ignore missing %}
[osd.4]
{% include "ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.d/osd4.conf" ignore missing %}

Where the osd[1,2,3,4].conf files contain the OSD specific configuration
options.
