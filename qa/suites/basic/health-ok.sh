# DeepSea integration test "suites/basic/health-ok.sh"
#
# This script runs DeepSea stages 0-3 to deploy a Ceph cluster, optionally
# with data-at-rest encryption of OSDs, on all the nodes that have at least
# one external disk drive. After stage 3 completes, the script checks for
# HEALTH_OK and tests the "ceph.restart" orchestration.
#
# The script makes no assumptions beyond those listed in qa/README.
#
# On success (HEALTH_OK is reached and "ceph.restart" orchestration behaves
# as expected), the script returns 0. On failure, for whatever reason, the
# script returns non-zero.
#
# The script produces verbose output on stdout, which can be captured for later
# forensic analysis.
